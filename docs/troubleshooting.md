# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for the Obsidian MCP Plugin.

## Connection Refused

**Symptoms:**
AI client cannot connect to the MCP server.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check plugin is enabled**: Settings → Community plugins → Semantic MCP should be enabled
2. **Verify server is running**: Look for the MCP status indicator in Obsidian's status bar
3. **Check port availability**: Default ports are 3001 (HTTP) and 3443 (HTTPS)
4. **Firewall**: Ensure your firewall allows local connections on these ports

## Authentication Errors

**Symptoms:**
Connection works but requests are rejected with 401/403 errors.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check API key**: Ensure the key in your client JSON config matches the one shown in plugin settings
2. **Check config location**: For Claude Code, the config lives in `~/.claude/settings.json` (user scope) or `.mcp.json` (project scope). Verify the `headers.Authorization` value matches `Bearer <your key>` (note the space after Bearer)
3. **Regenerated key**: The API key regenerates on plugin updates — copy the new key from settings and update your config file

## SSL Certificate Errors

**Symptoms:**
Certificate warnings, TLS handshake failures, or silent connection failures when using HTTPS. The failure mode is often silent on the server side — the TLS handshake aborts before the HTTP request is sent, so the plugin's debug log shows nothing at all. Bun-based clients (for example, any CLI running on the Bun runtime) can fail this way even when the certificate has been trusted in Keychain Access, because **Bun does not consult the macOS system keychain for TLS trust**.

**Solution:**
Trust the plugin's self-signed certificate properly. See [Trusting the self-signed certificate](../README.md#trusting-the-self-signed-certificate) in the main README for the full instructions, which cover:

- **macOS Keychain** (`security add-trusted-cert`) — for clients that use the system trust store.
- **`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`** — required for Bun-based runtimes; set via `launchctl setenv` to propagate to dock-launched GUI apps.

The plugin auto-generates a self-signed certificate on first start and stores it under `.obsidian/plugins/semantic-vault-mcp/certificates/default.crt` inside your vault. You will need to re-trust it whenever the plugin regenerates it (for example, after the 1-year validity expires).

**Avoid `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`:**
This environment variable disables TLS certificate verification process-wide — not just for the plugin, but for every HTTPS connection the client makes. That is a significant downgrade to your security posture, and it masks legitimate certificate problems (expired, revoked, or tampered certs) instead of fixing them. Trust the plugin certificate explicitly as described above.

## Server Not Starting

**Symptoms:**
MCP status bar shows error or server doesn't respond.

**Solutions:**
1. **Port conflict**: Another application may be using ports 3001/3443. Change ports in plugin settings.
2. **Check console**: Open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and check for error messages
3. **Restart plugin**: Disable and re-enable the plugin in Community plugins settings

## Dataview/Bases Not Working

**Symptoms:**
Dataview queries or Bases operations return errors.

**Solutions:**
1. **Install required plugins**: Dataview and/or Bases plugins must be installed and enabled
2. **Wait for indexing**: After opening a vault, wait for plugins to finish indexing
3. **Query syntax**: Ensure DQL queries are properly formatted

## Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
Slow responses or timeouts.

**Solutions:**
1. **Large vault**: Enable pagination in search results
2. **Complex queries**: Use more specific search terms
3. **Graph traversal**: Limit depth for large, highly-connected vaults
4. **Debug logging**: Disable debug logging in production (Settings → Semantic MCP)

## n8n Integration

**Symptoms:**
n8n MCP tool reports "unable to connect" or expects SSE endpoint.

**Cause:**
Older versions of n8n only support SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport, while this plugin uses Streamable HTTP transport (the newer MCP standard).

**Solution:**
Update n8n to the latest version which supports Streamable HTTP transport.

**Configuration:**
```
MCP URL: http://<your-ip>:3001/mcp
```

Ensure the plugin is enabled and the server is running (check the status bar in Obsidian).

## Session Errors

**Symptoms:**
Requests fail with JSON-RPC error code `-32001` and message "MCP session expired or unknown".

**What's happening:**
The client is sending a session ID that the server no longer recognizes (e.g., after a plugin reload or session timeout). The plugin attempts automatic recovery with retry:

1. **Automatic healing with retry**: The server creates a new transport and runs an internal compat-initialize, trying up to 3 protocol versions. If the server is transiently unavailable (e.g., plugin still loading, vault syncing), this cycle retries up to 3 times with linear backoff (0ms, 500ms, 1000ms) before giving up. Worst case: 9 init requests over ~1.5 seconds.
2. **Alias convergence**: On success, a short-lived alias maps the old session ID to the new one (5-minute TTL). Subsequent requests with the stale ID resolve via the alias without re-running recovery. The response includes an `Mcp-Session-Id` header with the canonical session ID — clients should adopt it.
3. **Recovery failure**: If all retry attempts are exhausted, the server returns a structured error:
   ```json
   {
     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
     "error": {
       "code": -32001,
       "message": "MCP session expired or unknown",
       "data": {
         "reason": "unknown_session",
         "recoverable": true,
         "retry": "initialize",
         "sessionId": "<new-session-id>"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

**Solutions:**
1. **Automatic**: Most clients recover automatically — the plugin heals sessions transparently in most cases
2. **Manual**: If the error persists, send a fresh `initialize` request to establish a new session
3. **Check plugin**: If sessions keep expiring, verify the plugin hasn't been reloaded or restarted

## System Info and Diagnostics

The `system(action='info')` tool returns server health data useful for debugging:

- **httpPort / httpsPort**: Active ports with enabled/disabled status
- **serverUptime**: Seconds since server start
- **sessionHealth**: `activeSessions`, `totalRequests`, and `activeAliases` (stale session recovery mappings)
